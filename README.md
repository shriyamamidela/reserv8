However there has been a drastic change in the prices all of a sudden.Prices have been almost doubled . I used to have a dal makhani at 180 rs and now its priced at 300 rs.. I believe the management needs to seriously rethink if increasing prices by almost 50% is really a good decision with no changes in ambience. ?

Even other restraunts like sardarji ka dhaba and Moti Mahal have lower prices and better ambience..With hike in prices, customer expects a sophisticated and improved ambience, fancy cutlery on the table .. well decorated tables , and much more to look at such as clean washrooms to use, well dressed waiters.. etc..Hope the management would rethink..',3,17.4489075,78.438224,'8, PLOT NO 8, OYO Townhouse, 164, ESI Diagnostics Rd, Model Colony, Sundar Nagar, Sanath Nagar, Hyderabad, Telangana 500038, India'),

If you want authentic Hyderabadi biryani, then this should be a default option. Have tried multiple dishes from this place so this is kind of a general review. The chicken biryani is their specialility. Large fragrant rice which are flaky and yet not oily provide a perfect blend with juicy chicken pieces. Only note is that they serve with one giant chicken piece in the biryani. Smaller pieces would make the biryani more manageable. The quantity is definitely something where even 4 people can easily enjoy a meal.We tried their haleem too in this Ramzan and it was delicious. Creamy texture with generous chunks of mutton and a small spicy kick to the taste, something which I really prefer in my haleem.
